# üîç Workspace

`Workspace` provides a simple way to hide files you don't want to be visible while coding.

A package by [Fooxly](https://www.fooxly.com).

## üìï Features

* Hide specific folders and files from your project
* View your hidden files
* Bring back a hidden file or folder

## üìê Configuration

*There are no settings at the moment, there will be in the future.*

**NOTE:** if you do have files / folders inside the files.exclude setting (per workspace).
You will need to add them to the `workspace.exclude` setting.

## Future plans

* Settings for the priority of the statusbar item
* Change the color of the filename to gray when viewing the hidden files / folders
* Option to show the amount of hidden folders (or files) inside of your project (inside the statusbar)
